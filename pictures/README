The program p5pgmtoasn.c reads a "P5" format portable grey map image
from its standard input and writes an assignment problem in DIMACS
format on its standard output. On many systems, you can get
information on this file format by typing "man pgm".

For information about how assignment problems are generated from
pictures, see the technical report pub/goldberg/stan-cs-93-1481.ps.Z
(compressed postscript), available by anonymous ftp from
