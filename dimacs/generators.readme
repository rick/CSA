This directory contains programs that generate networks and graphs.
Most are in the DIMACS format.

This Directory Contains:

universal.c  : A very portable random number generator, as C-language
               function calls.  Read the in-line code.

matching/  : A directory of generators for matching problems.

net-simple/  : A directory containing some very simple-minded generators,
                for checking compatiblity with DIMACS format.  These
                generators are not much good for testing code.

network/   : A directory containing generators for network problems.
