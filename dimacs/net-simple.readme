This directory contains very simple generators for network problems.
Also contains translators from .asn and .max files to .min files.
THESE GENERATORS PRODUCED INSTANCES WHICH ARE SYNTACTICALLY CORRECT
(FOR DIMACS CHALLENGE FORMAT) BUT WHICH ARE PRETTY MUCH UNINTERESTING
OTHERWISE.

genasn.c   Generate an instance for assignment.  See comments in
	   program for command format.  C source.

genmin.c   Generate an instance for min-cost flow.  See comments in
	   code for instructions.  C source.

genmax.c   Generate an instance for max flow.  See comments in
	   code for instructions. C source.

makefile   The make file.

test.*     Sample input files.  The suffix .min .max .asn denotes
           inputs for min-cost flow, max flow, and assignment.

asnmin.a   An awk program to convert assignment instances, in
	   .asn format, to min-cost flow instances  in .min format.

maxmin.a   An awk program toconver max-flow instances, in .max format,
	   to min-cost flow instances in .min format.
