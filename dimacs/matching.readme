This directory contains instance generators for matching problems.

asnmat.a    : Awk program to convert DIMACS .asn format to
              .edge format.

clusters.c  : Generates points within a circle which are clustered
		according to some input parameters.  Documentation is
		in code.  To compile: cc clusters.c -lm

dcube.c    : Generates points uniform within a d-dimensional cube.
             Documentation is in the code.

hardcard.f  : Generates (nongeometric) graphs which Gabow has shown
		will be hard for Edmond's cardinality matching algorithm.
 		Provided by R. B. Mattingly.  This is a Fortran program.
                To compile:  f77 hardcard.f

neighbor.c  : Takes a graph in .geom format and a command line argument
              k.  Produces a graph in .edge format.  Vertex i is has an
              edge to vertices [i-k, i-1].  See the code for more
              documentation.
              NOTE:  a version which includes the p line and which is
                 slightly more robust was installed July 26.

random.c    : Generates a random undirected graph with m edges.  Edge
              weights are uniformly distributed within a specified range.
              See the code for further documentation.
              NOTE: the original version contains a bug.  The fixed
              version was installed July 22.

t.f        :  Generates a sequence of K one-connected triangles
              in  .edge format.
              Written in Fortran.  These graphs tend to generate
               a lot of blossoms.
              Contributed by N. Ritchey and B. Mattingly

tt.f       :  Generates a sequence of K tri-connected triangles
              in .edge format.
              Written in Fortran.
              Contributed by N. Ritchey and B. Mattingly

fractals/   : Subdirectory containing generators of fractal-like instances,
               in .geom format.
