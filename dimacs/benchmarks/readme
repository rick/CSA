The ftp directory  pub/netflow/benchmarks contains two subdirectories 
for benchmark tests of your local computing environment. 

fortran/   Contains programs and inputs for a test of a Fortran program. 
           In that directory, see either  readme.unix  or  readme.notunix 
           depending upon whether your system can support Unix tools 
           such as pipes, awk, and shell programs.

c/         Contains programs and inputs for a test of a C program. 
           In that directory, see either  readme.unix  or readme.notunix
           depending upon whether your system can support Unix tools. 

If you can, run both the Fortran and C tests on your local system.  The 
goal is to gather timing information for a wide variety of architectures.

Given the variety of architectures that participants are using, it is
difficult to anticipate what will be possible and interesting.  Send a
note to  netflow@dimacs.rutgers.edu  if one of the following occurs:

1) Some input files are too large to be transferred to your system.
2) Some input files are too small to give interesting runtimes. 
3) Some other problem prevents you from performing the tests. 

Enjoy!
